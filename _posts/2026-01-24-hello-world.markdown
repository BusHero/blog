I always wanted to start my own blog. All important people had one and so should I. I had numerous failled attempts over the years. But, as a programmer, you have to create a blogging framework first. You spend a day or two trying to figure things out, get bored and move on to more intersting things.
Enough of that.
There are few motivations.
I want to share my ideas.
I want to improve my writing skills.
I want to clear my mind as clear writing is clear thinking

I will write a new blog post each week on a variety of topics.
