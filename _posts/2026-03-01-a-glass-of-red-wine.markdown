A glass of red wine, a platter of brie  
I wish you are here, enjoying them with me

Chess and reversi, in the park under a tree  
I wish you are there, playing with me

Movies and series, Wimbledon on TV  
I wish you are there, watching with me

Hiking into mountains, swimming in sea  
I wish you are there, experiencing with me

Budapest and Majorca, Vietnam and Fiji  
I wish you are there, traveling with me

Good days and bad days, sorrow and glee,  
I wish you are there, feeling with me

Beginnings and endings, as they may be  
I wish you are there, being with me

A glass of red wine, a platter of brie  
I wish we enjoy them, but you are not here
